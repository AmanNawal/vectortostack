# vectortostack
vector2stack is a static library which can be used in a program to convert a vector data stucture into a stack data structure.
In the source code one needs to include "vector2stack" in order to use the function present in the static library.
This particular library consists of one and only function named create_stack(vector,stack) would take a vector and a empty stack as arguments.
If the stack is already filled with some data this function in the library will just add the vector data to the already existing data in the stack.
